Users must run the packages using the intergrated terminal within the VS Code editor and run `npm install` followed by each of the package names. Example: `npm install express`
 
  ## Usage 
The application is important to help users keep track of a myriad of information. It is easy to forget tasks, appointments and important events, so Note Saver helps users have their written information in text notes and available to them when needed.
